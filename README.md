A modular and extensible Python port of the [TUD-AMR MPC Planner](https://github.com/tud-amr/mpc_planner), designed for real-time motion planning under constraints. PyMPC brings together math utilities, solver-agnostic optimization backends (e.g. CasADi, OSQP), and a flexible constraint interface to support rapid prototyping and deployment of Model Predictive Control systems.

| **GaussianConstraints**| Chance constraints using Gaussian distributions     | Risk level (Œ±), covariance of obstacle| Smooth, risk-adjustable, mathematically elegant | Requires accurate uncertainty model; heavier solve |
| **ScenarioConstraints**| Monte Carlo sampling of obstacle trajectories       | Number of scenarios, safe horizon    | Robust to arbitrary distributions           | Very expensive, needs many solvers in parallel   |
| **GuidanceConstraints**| Uses multiple global guidance paths to hedge risk   | Number of homotopy classes (paths)   | Finds safe topologies, avoids local minima | Indirect uncertainty handling, depends on guidance planner |
